# BANK LOAN DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL AND POWER BI

# SnapShots
# 1. Summary Loan Portfolio Performance Dashboard
To visualize the SQL insights, interactive dashboards were created in Power BI. These dashboards provide a clear view of loan applications, repayments, risk distribution, and portfolio performance.

- Shows Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and DTI.
- Provides Good Loan vs Bad Loan distribution with percentages, funded amounts, and repayment status.
- Loan Status breakdown (Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off) gives a snapshot of portfolio health.
