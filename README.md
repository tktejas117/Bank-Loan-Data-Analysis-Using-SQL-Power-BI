# BANK LOAN DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL AND POWER BI

# SnapShots
# 1. Summary Loan Portfolio Performance Dashboard
To visualize the SQL insights, interactive dashboards were created in Power BI. These dashboards provide a clear view of loan applications, repayments, risk distribution, and portfolio performance.

- Shows Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and DTI.
- Provides Good Loan vs Bad Loan distribution with percentages, funded amounts, and repayment status.
- Loan Status breakdown (Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off) gives a snapshot of portfolio health.

# 2. Loan Trends & Borrower Insights

- Highlights loan application trends by month to track growth.
- Geographic analysis by state identifies regions with high lending activity.
- Demographics & categories:
- Loan applications by Employee Length (borrower stability).
- Loan applications by Purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card, small business).
- Distribution by Loan Term and Home Ownership.

# 3. Detailed Loan Performance Analysis

- Provides a grid view of loan-level information (ID, Purpose, Ownership, Grade, Issue Date, Funded Amount, Interest Rate, Installments, Amount Received).
- Useful for deep dives into individual loans and borrower profiles.
- Supports filters by State, Grade, Loan Status, and Good vs Bad Loan for flexible analysis.

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Bank Loan Data using SQL and Power BI. The goal is to extract valuable insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, borrower risk profiles, and trends. The README provides the projectâ€™s **objectives, dataset details, project structure, SQL KPIs, dashboards, and key findings. 
## Objectives

- Analyze loan applications and funding trends across time.
- Track repayment performance and overall portfolio health.
- Evaluate **Good Loan vs Bad Loan** performance metrics.
- Study borrower demographics such as employment length, home ownership, purpose, and regions.
- Identify risk patterns using KPIs like **DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)** and **Interest Rate**.
- Provide interactive dashboards for decision-making using **Power BI**.

## Conclusion
This project not only provided deep insights into the bankâ€™s loan portfolio performance, but also strengthened my SQL and Power BI skills.

- Using SQL, I extracted, cleaned, and structured the data to calculate critical KPIs like Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Interest Rate, and DTI.

- In Power BI, I applied data modelling, DAX, Power Query, and time intelligence functions to create interactive dashboards.

- Designed visuals, KPIs, and navigation for users to explore trends, borrower insights, and loan performance effectively.

- Overall, the project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can help financial institutions monitor loan health, minimize risk, and make informed business decisions.
